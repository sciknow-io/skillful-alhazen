# Job Hunting Notebook Skill

Use this skill to manage your job search as a knowledge graph. Claude acts as your career coach, building understanding of positions, companies, and your fit over time.

## Philosophy: The Curation Pattern

This skill follows the **curation design pattern**:

1. **FORAGING** - Discover job postings (user provides URLs)
2. **INGESTION** - Script fetches raw content, stores as artifact
3. **SENSEMAKING** - Claude reads artifact, extracts entities, creates notes
4. **ANALYSIS** - Query across notes to answer questions
5. **REPORTING** - Dashboard views of pipeline and skills

**Key separation:**
- **Script handles**: Fetching URLs, storing raw content, TypeDB queries
- **Claude handles**: Reading artifacts, extracting meaning, creating notes, reasoning

## Prerequisites

- TypeDB must be running: `docker compose -f docker-compose-typedb.yml up -d`
- Dependencies installed: `uv sync --all-extras` (from project root)

## Environment Variables

- `TYPEDB_HOST`: TypeDB server (default: localhost)
- `TYPEDB_PORT`: TypeDB port (default: 1729)
- `TYPEDB_DATABASE`: Database name (default: alhazen_notebook)

## Your Skill Profile

Before analyzing jobs, set up your skill profile for gap analysis.

### Add Your Skills

```bash
# Add skills with your level
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-skill \
    --name "Python" --level "strong"

uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-skill \
    --name "Machine Learning" --level "strong"

uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-skill \
    --name "Distributed Systems" --level "some" \
    --description "Built caching layer, some k8s experience"

uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-skill \
    --name "Rust" --level "learning"
```

**Skill levels:**
- `strong` - Confident, production experience
- `some` - Working knowledge, need to brush up
- `learning` - Currently studying
- `none` - No experience yet

### View Your Skills

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py list-skills
```

## Ingestion: Adding Job Postings

### From URL

**Triggers:** "add job", "ingest job", "new position", "found a job posting", "here's a job"

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py ingest-job \
    --url "https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/123456" \
    --priority high \
    --tags "ai" "ml" "safety"
```

This stores the raw job posting as an artifact. Claude will do the sensemaking.

**Options:**
- `--url` (required): Job posting URL
- `--priority`: Set priority (high/medium/low)
- `--tags`: Space-separated tags

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "position_id": "position-abc123",
  "artifact_id": "artifact-xyz789",
  "status": "raw",
  "message": "Artifact stored - ask Claude to 'analyze this job posting' for sensemaking."
}
```

---

## Sensemaking: Claude Analyzes Artifacts

**This is where Claude's comprehension matters.** When the user asks to analyze a job posting, Claude reads the raw artifact and extracts structured information.

### List Artifacts Needing Analysis

```bash
# Show artifacts that haven't been analyzed yet
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py list-artifacts --status raw

# Show all artifacts
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py list-artifacts --status all
```

### Get Artifact Content

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py show-artifact --id "artifact-xyz789"
```

### Sensemaking Workflow

**When user says "analyze this job posting" or "make sense of [position]":**

1. **Get the artifact content**
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py show-artifact --id "artifact-xyz"
   ```

2. **Read and comprehend the content**
   - Look for: company name, job title, location, salary, remote policy
   - Identify: requirements, responsibilities, qualifications
   - Note: team info, culture signals, growth opportunities

3. **Create/update the company**
   If company doesn't exist yet:
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-company \
       --name "Anthropic" \
       --url "https://anthropic.com" \
       --description "AI safety research company"
   ```

4. **Extract requirements as fragments**
   For each distinct skill/requirement:
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-requirement \
       --position "position-abc123" \
       --skill "Python" \
       --level "required" \
       --your-level "strong" \
       --content "5+ years Python experience, focus on ML systems"
   ```

   Compare `--skill` to user's profile:
   - Look up skill in `list-skills`
   - Set `--your-level` based on match

5. **Create analysis notes**

   **Fit Analysis Note:**
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-note \
       --about "position-abc123" \
       --type fit-analysis \
       --content "Strong fit for core requirements (Python, ML). Gap in distributed systems (required) - you have some experience but need to demonstrate scale." \
       --fit-score 0.82 \
       --fit-summary "Strong technical fit, one gap to address"
   ```

   **Research Note (company info):**
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-note \
       --about "company-xyz" \
       --type research \
       --content "Series C, $4B raised. Strong safety focus. Engineering blog shows Rust and Python stack."
   ```

   **Skill Gap Note (for each gap):**
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py add-note \
       --about "position-abc123" \
       --type skill-gap \
       --content "Distributed systems is required but you only have 'some' experience. Recommend: DDIA book, MIT 6.824 course."
   ```

6. **Flag uncertainties**
   If something is unclear, add tag "uncertain":
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py tag \
       --entity "requirement-xyz" \
       --tag "uncertain"
   ```

7. **Report findings to user**
   Summarize:
   - Company and role overview
   - Your fit score and breakdown
   - Key gaps to address
   - Suggested next steps

### Example Sensemaking Output

```

## Complete Workflow Example

```
User: Here's a job I'm interested in: https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/123

Claude: I'll ingest this posting and then analyze it.

[Runs ingest-job command]

Stored artifact. Now analyzing...

[Runs show-artifact to read content]
[Extracts company info, creates/updates company]
[Extracts requirements, creates requirement fragments]
[Compares to user's skill profile]
[Creates fit-analysis note, research note, skill-gap notes]

## Analysis: Senior Software Engineer at Anthropic

**Your Fit: 85%**
✓ Python (required) - you: strong
✓ ML Systems (required) - you: strong
△ Distributed Systems (required) - you: some
△ Rust (preferred) - you: learning

**Action Items:**
1. Review distributed systems concepts before applying
2. Set priority level?
3. Add to learning plan?

User: Set it to high priority. And yes, add a learning plan note.

Claude: [Updates priority, creates learning plan note]

Done! This is now a high-priority position. I've noted that you should
focus on distributed systems prep. Want me to find specific resources?
```

## TypeDB 2.x Reference

When writing custom TypeDB queries or scripts for job hunting data, consult the TypeDB documentation:

- **Full Reference:** `.claude/skills/typedb-notebook/typedb-2x-documentation.md`
- **JobHunt Schema:** `local_resources/typedb/namespaces/jobhunt.tql`
- **Core Schema:** `local_resources/typedb/alhazen_notebook.tql`

### Quick TypeQL Examples

```typeql
# Find all positions with a specific status
match
  $p isa jobhunt-position;
  $n isa jobhunt-application-note, has application-status "interviewing";
  (about: $p, note: $n) isa notation;
fetch $p: name, job-url;

# Update an attribute (delete old, insert new)
match
  $r isa jobhunt-learning-resource, has resource-url $old;
  $old "https://old-url.com";
delete $r has $old;
insert $r has resource-url "https://new-url.com";
```

### Common Pitfalls

- **No `optional` in fetch** - Use separate queries for optional attributes
- **Update = delete + insert** - Can't modify attributes in place
- **Use semicolons** between match patterns (implicit AND)
