# Domain Modeling — Usage Reference

## The Curation Design Pattern

All domain skills follow a 6-phase workflow:

```

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: TASK DEFINITION - What Is This Curation FOR?

**What it is:** Capturing the goal, decision, or research question that the entire curation pipeline exists to serve. A task is defined in natural language (name + description) and stored as a TypeDB entity.

**Why it matters:** Without an explicit task, curation has no anchor. The task:
- Drives what you forage for (what counts as relevant?)
- Frames sensemaking (what do I extract? what questions do I ask?)
- Scopes analysis (which notes are relevant to this goal?)
- Organizes reporting (show me everything contributing to task X)

**Task states:** `active` (in progress), `completed` (goal achieved), `on-hold` (paused)

**Examples by domain:**

| Domain | Example Task |
|--------|-------------|
| Job hunting | "Find a senior ML engineering role at a mission-driven company in the Bay Area by Q3" |
| Literature review | "Understand the state of evidence for CRISPR off-target effects in vivo" |
| Biology research | "Identify candidate genes for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome subtype 6" |
| News investigation | "Map the network of venture-backed edtech companies expanding into adult learning" |

**Key insight:** A task is the anchor for reporting. "Show me all analysis notes that contribute to my job search task" is a natural query once `task-contribution` relations exist.

---

### Phase 1: FORAGING - Discovering Sources

**What it is:** Finding things in the world worth capturing. Often the most creative/expansive phase.

**Examples by domain:**
| Domain | Foraging Activities |
|--------|---------------------|
| Job hunting | Job boards, company career pages, VC portfolio sites, LinkedIn, referrals |
| Literature review | PubMed, Google Scholar, citation chains, conference proceedings |
| News investigation | RSS feeds, social media, press releases, public records |
| Biology research | Databases (UniProt, GenBank), preprints, lab websites |

**Key insight:** Foraging can be recursive - finding one thing leads to discovering others.

---

### Phase 2: INGESTION - Raw Capture with Provenance

**What it is:** Pulling material in UNEDITED format. The artifact is the authoritative record.

**Critical properties:**
- **Provenance** - Where did this come from? (URL, timestamp, API, email)
- **Immutability** - The raw content doesn't change after capture
- **Completeness** - Capture the whole thing, not just parts you think matter now

**Maps to TypeDB:**
```
Artifact (raw content)
├── owns source-uri
├── owns created-at (timestamp)
├── owns content (full text/HTML)
└── plays representation:artifact → Thing
```

**Script responsibility:** Fetch and store raw content. NO parsing, NO extraction, NO interpretation.

```python
def ingest_url(url):
    content = fetch(url)
    artifact_id = store_artifact(
        content=content,
        source_url=url,
        retrieved_at=now(),
        content_type=detect_type(content)
    )
    return artifact_id  # Claude does the rest
```

**Browser-based ingestion tip:** When using Playwright to browse large web pages (especially LinkedIn profiles), use `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` instead of parsing the DOM snapshot. The accessibility tree for these pages can be 100KB+ and easy to misread.

---

### Phase 3: SENSEMAKING - Claude Reads and Extracts

**What it is:** Claude reads the artifact and creates structured understanding.

**Sensemaking Subtasks:**

| Subtask | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Parsing** | Understanding document structure | Structure map |
| **Entity Extraction** | Identifying named entities | Entities → Things |
| **Relation Extraction** | How entities connect | Relations |
| **Classification** | Categorizing (role type, seniority) | Tags |
| **Summarization** | Condensing key points | Notes |
| **Gap Analysis** | Comparing against known profile | Skill-gap notes |
| **Inference** | Drawing conclusions not explicitly stated | Analysis notes |

**Maps to TypeDB:**
```
Fragment (extracted piece of artifact)
├── owns content (the specific text)
├── plays extraction:fragment → Artifact (provenance back to source)
└── plays aboutness:subject ← Note (Claude's interpretation)

Note (Claude's understanding)
├── owns content (Claude's interpretation/analysis)
├── owns confidence (how sure Claude is)
├── plays aboutness:note → [Thing, Artifact, Fragment, other Notes]
└── owns tags
```

**Key architectural point:** Sensemaking is ITERATIVE. Claude might:
1. First pass: Extract obvious entities (company name, job title, location)
2. Second pass: Deeper analysis (requirements, responsibilities, culture signals)
3. Later: Re-analyze when you have more context (compare to other postings)

---

### Phase 4: ANALYZE / SUMMARIZE - Reasoning Over Time

**What it is:** Looking across many sensemaking notes to answer questions and generate insights.

**Examples:**
- "What skills appear most frequently across my high-priority positions?"
- "How does this company's culture compare to others I'm considering?"

**Output:** Synthesis notes that reference multiple sources

```
Synthesis Note
├── about → [position-1, position-2, position-3]
├── content: "Across these three roles, distributed systems appears
│            as required in 2/3 and preferred in 1/3. This is your
│            biggest gap. Recommend prioritizing DDIA book."
└── tags: [synthesis, skill-gaps, recommendation]
```

---

### Phase 5: REPORT - Presentation for Action

**Dashboard components:**
- **Pipeline views** - Where things stand (Kanban)
- **Matrices** - Comparisons across dimensions (skills × positions)
- **Progress tracking** - Learning plan completion
- **Alerts** - Deadlines, required actions
- **Deep dives** - All context about a specific entity

**Key insight:** Reports should be generated from TypeDB queries, not stored separately.

## Artifact Types Registry

Artifact types are shared across all skills. Reuse existing types rather than creating new ones.

### Standard Artifact Types

| Type | Cache Dir | MIME Types | Example Uses |
|------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| `html` | `html/` | text/html | Job postings, web articles, company pages |
| `pdf` | `pdf/` | application/pdf | Papers, resumes, reports, cover letters |
| `image` | `image/` | image/* | Screenshots, figures, diagrams |
| `json` | `json/` | application/json | API responses, structured exports |
| `text` | `text/` | text/plain, text/markdown | Plain text content, notes |

### Storage Strategy

- **< 50KB:** Store inline in TypeDB `content` attribute
- **>= 50KB:** Store in cache, reference via `cache-path`

```python
from skillful_alhazen.utils.cache import should_cache, save_to_cache

if should_cache(content):
    cache_result = save_to_cache(artifact_id, content, mime_type)
    # Store cache_result['cache_path'] in TypeDB
else:
    # Store content inline in TypeDB
```

---

## Designing a New Domain

### Step 1: Identify Entity Types

| Alhazen Type | Your Domain | Example (Job Hunt) | Example (Lit Review) |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Task** | The goal framing the curation | "Find a senior ML role" | "Understand CRISPR off-target effects" |
| **Thing** | Primary items you track | Company, Position | Paper, Author |
| **Artifact** | Raw captured content | Job Description | PDF, Abstract |
| **Fragment** | Extracted pieces | Requirement | Claim, Method |
| **Note** | Claude's analysis | Fit Analysis | Critique, Summary |

### Step 2: Define Attributes

```typeql
jobhunt-position sub domain-thing,
    owns job-url,
    owns salary-range,
    owns location,
    owns remote-policy;
```

### Step 3: Define Relations

```typeql
position-at-company sub relation,
    relates position,
    relates employer;
```

### Step 4: Design Script Commands

**Ingestion commands** (script does the work):
- `ingest-<source>` - Fetch and store raw content
- `add-<entity>` - Manual entity creation

**Query commands** (script queries, returns data):
- `list-<entities>` - List with filters
- `show-<entity>` - Full details
- `list-artifacts` - Artifacts pending analysis

**Update commands** (script updates TypeDB):
- `update-<attribute>` - Change entity attributes
- `tag` - Add tags to entities

### Step 5: Write Sensemaking Instructions

In your USAGE.md, tell Claude what to extract. Example:

```markdown
## Sensemaking Workflow

When user asks to "analyze [artifact]":

1. Read artifact content
   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/domain/script.py show-artifact --id "artifact-xyz"
   ```

2. Extract entities:
   - [List what to look for]

3. Create fragments:
   - [List fragment types and what they contain]

4. Create analysis notes:
   - [List note types and their purpose]

5. Flag uncertainties with "uncertain" tag

6. Report summary to user
```

## TypeDB Schema Template

```typeql
define

# =============================================================================
# ATTRIBUTES (domain-specific)
# =============================================================================

domain-attr-1, value string;
domain-attr-2, value datetime;
task-status, value string;   # active | completed | on-hold

# =============================================================================
# ENTITIES - Task (Phase 0: what this curation is FOR)
# =============================================================================

# Inherits id @key, name, description from domain-thing.
# Natural-language goal goes in description.
my-domain-task sub domain-thing,
    owns task-status,
    plays task-scope:task,
    plays task-contribution:task;

# =============================================================================
# ENTITIES - Things
# =============================================================================

my-domain-entity sub domain-thing,
    owns domain-attr-1,
    plays domain-relation:role;

# =============================================================================
# ENTITIES - Artifacts
# =============================================================================

my-domain-artifact sub artifact;

# =============================================================================
# ENTITIES - Fragments
# =============================================================================

my-domain-fragment sub fragment,
    owns domain-attr-1,
    plays domain-relation:role;

# =============================================================================
# ENTITIES - Notes
# =============================================================================

my-domain-note sub note,
    plays task-contribution:note;

# =============================================================================
# RELATIONS
# =============================================================================

domain-relation sub relation,
    relates role1,
    relates role2;

# Task scopes a collection (what body of knowledge serves this goal?)
task-scope sub relation,
    relates task,
    relates collection;

# Note contributes to a task (links sensemaking output back to the goal)
task-contribution sub relation,
    relates task,
    relates note;
```

## Example: Job Hunting Domain

### Entity Types
- `jobhunt-company` (Thing) - An employer
- `jobhunt-position` (Thing) - A job posting
- `jobhunt-job-description` (Artifact) - Raw JD content
- `jobhunt-requirement` (Fragment) - Extracted skill requirement
- `jobhunt-fit-analysis-note` (Note) - Claude's fit assessment

### Script Commands
- `ingest-job --url` - Fetch and store job posting
- `add-skill --name --level` - Add to your skill profile
- `list-artifacts --status raw` - Artifacts needing analysis
- `show-artifact --id` - Get artifact for Claude to read
- `list-pipeline` - Show application status

### Sensemaking Flow
1. Script ingests URL → creates artifact + placeholder position
2. User says "analyze that job posting"
3. Claude reads artifact content
4. Claude extracts: company, title, requirements, responsibilities
5. Claude compares to user's skill profile
6. Claude creates fit-analysis note with score and gaps
7. Claude reports findings and suggests next steps

---

## Example: Literature Review Domain

### Entity Types
- `litreview-paper` (Thing) - A scientific paper
- `litreview-author` (Thing) - A researcher
- `litreview-pdf` (Artifact) - PDF content
- `litreview-claim` (Fragment) - Key claim with evidence
- `litreview-synthesis` (Note) - Cross-paper analysis

### Script Commands
- `ingest-paper --doi` - Fetch from DOI
- `ingest-paper --pmid` - Fetch from PubMed
- `search-papers --query` - Search literature databases
- `list-papers --collection` - Papers in a collection
- `show-paper --id` - Full paper details

---

## User Profile Pattern

For domains where sensemaking depends on stable facts about the user — location,
constraints, preferences — define a profile entity so Claude never has to ask.

**When to use:** Any skill where analysis depends on the user-as-subject.
Examples: job hunting (location viability, salary floor), health tracking (conditions,
medications), learning (time budget, current level).

### Schema Template (TypeDB 3.x)

```typeql
# Profile attributes
attribute home-location, value string;
attribute my-domain-constraint, value string;

# Profile entity - inherits id, name, description from domain-thing.
# sub agent if the user is acting (job seeker, patient, learner).
# sub domain-thing if the user is an object being tracked.
# Singleton in practice; schema supports multi-user scenarios.
entity my-domain-user-profile sub agent,
    owns home-location,
    owns my-domain-constraint;
```

### CLI Convention

Two commands, always paired:

```bash
# Upsert: create if none exists, replace if one exists
script.py set-profile --location "..." --constraint "..."

# Read: single call that returns everything Claude needs for sensemaking
script.py show-profile
```

### Sensemaking Integration

In USAGE.md, instruct Claude to call `show-profile` **before** any analysis that
depends on user context:

```markdown
## Sensemaking Workflow
1. **Load seeker profile** (call FIRST — never ask the user for this information)
   script.py show-profile
   Use result to automatically assess: location viability, constraint alignment, gaps
```

The `show-profile` command should return the profile entity plus all related
inventory (skills, learning resources, etc.) in a single JSON response.

### Reference Implementation

See `local_skills/jobhunt/jobhunt.py` `cmd_set_profile` and `cmd_show_profile` for
a complete example (`jobhunt-seeker sub agent` with `home-location`, `salary-floor`,
`remote-preference`, linked skills and learning resources).

---

## Skill Quality Tracking

Record deficiencies discovered during skill use. When Claude has to ask something
that should have been stored, or makes an incorrect inference, log it as a
`schema-gap` for systematic improvement.

### What to Log

| Gap Type | When to Log |
|----------|-------------|
| `missing-user-context` | Had to ask the user for something that should be in the profile |
| `missing-entity-type` | No TypeDB type exists for something we needed to store |
| `missing-attribute` | Existing type lacks an attribute the workflow needed |
| `unclear-workflow` | Sensemaking instructions were ambiguous or produced wrong output |
| `incorrect-inference` | Claude's reasoning produced a factually wrong result |

### Commands (typedb-notebook skill)

```bash
# Record a gap
uv run python .claude/skills/typedb-notebook/typedb_notebook.py record-gap \
    --skill jobhunt \
    --type missing-user-context \
    --description "User home location not stored; had to ask about on-site viability" \
    --severity moderate \
    --example "GenBio AI on-site Palo Alto role: asked user if Palo Alto commute was viable"

# List open gaps for a skill
uv run python .claude/skills/typedb-notebook/typedb_notebook.py list-gaps --skill jobhunt

# List all open gaps
uv run python .claude/skills/typedb-notebook/typedb_notebook.py list-gaps

# Close a gap once addressed
uv run python .claude/skills/typedb-notebook/typedb_notebook.py close-gap \
    --id "gap-abc123" --status addressed
```

### System Improvement Loop

1. Claude encounters a gap during a workflow (asks user, makes wrong inference)
2. Immediately record it: `typedb-notebook record-gap --skill X --type Y --description "..."`
3. Periodically review: `typedb-notebook list-gaps` — use open gaps as improvement backlog
4. Fix the schema/workflow/profile, then close: `typedb-notebook close-gap --id X --status addressed`

The `skill-model` entity (auto-created by `record-gap`) is the first-class representation
of each skill in the knowledge graph. Multiple gaps can be linked to one skill-model.

---

## Dashboard Design Principles

1. **Query the graph** - Don't duplicate data; dashboards query TypeDB
2. **Pipeline views** - Show entities moving through states
3. **Matrix views** - Compare across dimensions
4. **Progress tracking** - Show completion of plans
5. **Deep dives** - Click to see all context about an entity

---

## Documenting Your New Domain

Every new domain skill needs documentation at four levels:

### Step 1: Skill Manifest (`skill.yaml`)

```yaml
name: my-domain
description: "Short description of what this skill does"
license: Apache-2.0
script: my_domain.py
schema: my_domain.tql
requires:
  bins: [uv, docker]
  env: [TYPEDB_HOST, TYPEDB_PORT, TYPEDB_DATABASE]
pattern: curation
phases:
  - foraging: "How sources are discovered"
  - ingestion: "How raw content is captured"
  - sensemaking: "What Claude extracts and analyzes"
  - analysis: "What cross-entity reasoning looks like"
  - reporting: "What dashboard views exist"
```

### Step 2: Query Examples (`local_resources/typedb/docs/query_examples.json`)

Add curated TypeQL examples for your namespace.

### Step 3: Regenerate Schema Docs

```bash
make docs-schema       # Generate local docs
make docs-schema-wiki  # Generate docs AND update wiki pages
```

### Step 4: Wiki Skill Page

Create `Skills:-<Domain>.md` in `~/Documents/Coding/skillful-alhazen.wiki/`. Follow `Skills:-Jobhunt.md` as a pattern.

### Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md

Add your skill to the "Available Skills" section so Claude knows about it.

### Documentation Maintenance

When you modify a schema:
1. `make docs-schema-wiki` — regenerate schema docs + wiki
2. Push wiki: `cd ~/Documents/Coding/skillful-alhazen.wiki && git add . && git commit -m 'Update schema docs' && git push`
3. Update `CLAUDE.md` Architecture section if hierarchy changed

## When to Create a New Domain

Create a new domain skill when:
1. You have a **specific information type** to track (papers, jobs, news, etc.)
2. Information comes from **discoverable sources** (APIs, URLs, databases)
3. You need to **reason over time** (not just one-shot questions)
4. Structure matters - entities have **attributes and relationships**
5. You want **Claude to build understanding** through sensemaking

Don't create a domain for:
- Simple lookups (use web search)
- One-time questions (just ask)
- Unstructured brainstorming (use notes)
